# Students-Learning-Style-Prediction-using-AI

The widespread use of online learning has been facilitated by advancements in information technology. 
Less pertinent assessments and applications are available for students, nevertheless.
All learning innovation efforts aim to improve education while simultaneously increasing student engagement in the classroom.
By choosing instructional resources that are suited for each student's learning preferences, teachers may increase the participation of
their students in the teaching-learning process.This project's goal is to create and assess how well an 
AI-based learning style prediction model performs in a student learning portal. In order to support the idea of personalised learning, 
an AI model was developed for the online learning site to provide educational resources that suit students' learning preferences.
Consequently, this project's goal is to create a user interactive application that helps student understand his way of learning and
improve himself in the way he understands and learns things.
